# Internship Hunt - 2020

Last edited: Feb 18, 2021

## Introduction

I recently finished my internship hunt for summer (and fall) of 2021, and I thought it'd be a good time to document my journey and share some advice. 

A bit about myself: I am a freshman studying Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. I am a junior by credit thanks to dual enrollment in high school. More information about my background can be found on my [resume](SunnyGuan_Resume.pdf), so I won't go too in-depth on them.

## Results:

- 158 applications
- 23 online assessments
- 12 first rounds (declined 6)
- 5 final rounds
- 5 offers

The offers are from (in order of date):

1. Walmart
2. Virtu Financial
3. USAA
4. MathWorks
5. Amazon

The full list of results can be seen on [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FuhZIdUgQVQZvKX06BJAAiSG7ISdLtVzPFQ-4lss2Ek/edit?usp=sharing). 

I accepted Virtu's offer for Fall 2021 as well as Amazon's offer for Summer 2021.

## Thoughts

I have to preface this by saying that the two biggest reasons that helped me this year is junior credit standing and competitive programming. For junior standing, I took 3 quarters of courses at my community college during my senior year, which cleared most of my lower division courses. For competitive programming, I am far from being proficient, but I spent a decent amount of time preparing for the USA Computing Olympiad starting in my freshman year of high school.

For general advice, here are a few things that helped me this year:

### Apply Everywhere

I applied to less than 10 companies in August, and I was hoping that I'd get something from just those handful of applications. Obviously that is not true, and applying to as many places as you can is the best way to increase your chance at getting an offer. Once you have a presentable resume that has been checked by the career center (or other professionals), just start applying everywhere. Normal companies start hiring as early as July, so it's best to start as early as possible. There are usually listings for internships (such as [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2021-Internships) for Summer 2021), so just go down the list and apply to every company. 

I also had some success with going to career fairs. I went to 8-9 one-on-one sessions during the fall semester, and I was able to both practice my communication skills and get a head start on the interviewing process. I received my Walmart and USAA offers through this process.

### Communication

The behavioral parts of interviews are very important. By presenting yourself as friendly, passionate, and enthusiastic, interviewers are much more likely to see themselves working with you. This means working on your elevator pitch, as well as preparing for the common behavioral questions so you don't sound like you're making something up on the spot. Practice in front of the mirror and do mock interviews to get a realistic sense of how the interviewer might judge you. 

I tutored computer science during my senior year and math during my junior year. Since I had to teach a lot of math and CS problems, I was able to practice my communication skills which is super helpful for technical interviews. When I solve technical problems during interviews, it is very similar to explaining my thought process while solving a new geometry problem for middle school students. Being able to articulate your thought process is very important even when you are stuck, so definitely spend time practicing whether it's through tutoring like me or explaining problems out loud or to a friend.

### LeetCode

Almost all companies have some kind of LeetCode problem in their interviews, so I highly recommend dedicating time and effort to get good at it. Start by working through the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list, and then gradually work through other problems by topic and difficulty. There are different requirements for different companies, but having a good grasp of easy's and being able to solve 50% of mediums is a good goal for being comfortable. For the hardest companies (quant), you should be comfortable with hard problems and be able to solve > 95% of medium problems.

Having a consistent practice schedule is very important for LeetCode. Doing 1-3 problems per day can add up and keep your skills sharp throughout the year. I also highly recommend [Binary Search](binarysearch.com), which is similar to LeetCode but has a much cleaner interface and you can compete against your friends. I have done over 400 problems on Binary Search and around 200 on LeetCode, and it definitely helped for my confidence as well as actual interview performance.

## Goals

With Virtu and Amazon this year, I am hoping to get a much better response rate for next summer's internships. I did not do any networking this semester (besides career fair); however, I've heard a lot of success stories there so I'll definitely start doing that to prepare for next year. Some tools that might be helpful are [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-guan/), [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.com), SalesQL/Hunter.io, and [Recruiter LinkedIn Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xzy5WT_r_0Bc643Y38CfbeWEoQpjk59DfFw94vkdVfU/edit#gid=0).
