## Timeline

### Before August

April: I started working on UTD Course Search, which adds in professor ratings and past GPA information for courses onto UTD's course catalog. It wasn't a huge project, but it would turn out to be an amazing project to chat about with interviewers. 

July: I started contributing to UTDegreePlanner, which was made by [Nitin Ankad](ankad.io). It also wasn't a huge team-based project, but it led to a ton of exciting challenges (which are great for interviews) as well as my current work on Project Nebula (a comprehensive degree planner built under ACM Development). 

To be completely honest, I had no idea that working on side projects was so important for students without prior experience; however, it certainly paid off.

### August

Before school started, I was only vaguely aware of the importance of internships. My parents sent me a list of tech companies that paid the most salary to interns, but I didn't think about it too much since I didn't think I'd be able to get an offer as a freshman anyway. I applied to Microsoft and Amazon towards the end of August, but did not do much other than that.

### September

I was accepted into ACM Research and ACM Development, which is when I started reading more about internships on the ACM Discord. I applied to a few more internships, and went to the career fair hosted by the ECS department here at UTD. I talked to a few recruiters at the career fair, but didn't get a lot of responses afterwards since I had 2024 listed on my resume. 

Towards the end of september, I came across the [PittCSC GitHub](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2021-Internships) which has a list of companies that are hiring interns as well as the application link. I decided to start applying to as many companies as possible even if it was just for the interviewing experience.

### October

I sent out around 100 applications in the first week of October, and finally landed my first interview (not HireVue) by reaching out to the Walmart recruiter via email. I talked to her during the career fair (and she was really impressed by my projects), but I had 2024 on my resume back then so she told me to reach out when I am a junior. 

Towards the end of the month, I also interviewed with Ocient, Virtu, MathWorks, USAA, and Veeva (in that order). On 10/26, I received a verbal offer (my first offer!) from Walmart.

### November

On 11/2, I received my second offer from Virtu Financial, and I knew that I had to accept them when I heard the pay. I accepted the offer the following day, and turned down Ocient's final round interview invitation. A week later on 11/10, I received an offer from USAA; a day later on 11/11, I received an offer from MathWorks. I was also invited to Capital One's Software Engineering Summit on 11/17.

### December

I moved home before Thanksgiving break, and I did not send out any applications since I had already accepted Virtu (and did not plan on doing a fall internship). However, Amazon sent me their OA on 12/29, so I started that process and finished OA 3 on 12/31.

### January

January was mostly waiting for my Amazon OA result and scheduling the final interview. My interview was scheduled a *month* out, which was quite stress-inducing with news of waitlist starting in Canada. 

### February

I interviewed with Amazon on 2/12, and received an offer on 2/16. I am currently in the process of moving Virtu to fall so I can do Amazon during summer and Virtu during fall.
