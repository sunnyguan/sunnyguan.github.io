## Interviews

### Walmart (First Round)

Score: 8/10

Take-home project was sent out 24 hours before the interview, and it was a simple front-end project. I built it with plain HTML/CSS/JS with a lot of emphasis on being extra on the UI and features. 

During the interview, we went over the project briefly, and I was asked a few questions on basic CS concepts. After that, I was also asked questions on database, which I had no prior experience with. I felt the need to prove my skills after the DB questions, so I shared my side projects on my screen for a few minutes before the interview ended.

### Walmart (Final Round)

Score: 8.5/10

Interviewer was pretty disinterested throughout the entire interview, so I had no idea what they thought about my performance. I answered the behavioral questions (they were reading from a list) pretty well, and was able to get the LeetCode medium problem right after some confusion with the problem statement. I was satisfied with my performance but the interviewer did not show any emotion throughout the entire interview.

### Ocient (First Round)

Score: 10/10

I was asked a few general behavioral questions, and also briefly touched on my side projects. The technical question was on implementing a decently hard data structure. I was able to ace that section by immediately coming up with an efficient solution out loud, then implementing everything correctly without referencing Java syntax or other online material (which was allowed). The interviewer was very impressed by both my technical skills as well as my communicating skills (on behaviorals as well as talking about thought process for technical), so I knew I had definitely passed this round.

### Virtu (First Round)

Score: 9.5/10

I talked about UTDegreePlanner, and the interviewer also worked on a similar project in his university. We talked about the project for quite a while, then I worked through a LeetCode medium difficulty problem. I was able to solve it correctly without any errors, and was also able to answer the follow ups questions well. I was pretty confident in advancing to the next round after the interview.

### Virtu (Final Round)

Score: 10/10

#### Interviewer 1

Started with behaviorals, then went through some basic brainteasers. I was stuck on one of them for a bit, but I solved it with some calculus by sharing my screen and typing LaTeX. The interviewer said that it was great to see how I worked under pressure (of not being to solve the problem at first), so I was pretty happy with that.

#### Interviewer 2

Behaviorals as usual, then went through my projects and experience. The coding problem was implementing a simple data structure, so I didn't have any trouble with that. Since I finished the problem really early, I demo'ed all of my side projects and also had a fairly long conversation during the Q&A portion.

#### Interviewer 3

He started off by talking to me for around 20 minutes about his experience at Virtu and the culture there. Then, we went through a LeetCode medium/hard problem, and I was able to solve it quickly without any mistakes while clearly explaining my logic. He was pretty impressed with the code, so I was confident that I passed his round. 

### MathWorks (Frst Round)

Score: 7/10

I woke up 5 minutes before the interview, and I was asked to explain my logic in the OA that I did after applying. We then went through a LeetCode medium, a LeetCode hard, and a OOP class problem. I solved the medium, did not solve the hard, and solved the OOP problem. 

### MathWorks (Final Round)

Score: 10/10

Pure behavioral with a manager, and I had a great time bragging about myself for the list of behavioral questions that she went through. She was very impressed at the end of it, and I was sure that I'd receive an offer.

### USAA (First/Only Round)

Score: 5/10

Tons of behavioral questions to start, then a technical question (that I didn't need to code for) as well as a systems design question (that I bombed). I was sure I was going to get rejected the next day.

### Amazon (Final Round)

Score: 10/10

Went through 2 behavioral questions, then a LeetCode medium problem. I had prepped for an entire month prior to the interview, and it certainly paid off (especially for the behavioral portion).
